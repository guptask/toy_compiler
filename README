To build the compiler, type    :  make

In the 'src' directory, to 
build the ctags links, type    :  ./make-ctags
(needed only for code browsing)

To test a sample code, type    : ./compile <code_sample>
(code samples are present in 
'test' directory)

Notes:
-----

1. 'code' and 'code2' are code samples present in the 'test' 
   directory.

2. For special cases not mentioned in guidelines, C-type 
   rules have been followed eg. re-using of local variable 
   names in different procedures, etc.

3. GCC version 4.7.2 used during development.

4. Runtime library procedures (used in code samples) are:
   :- getInteger(integer a out)
   :- getBool(bool a out)
   :- getFloat(float a out)
   :- getString(string a in, integer b out)
   :- putInteger(integer a in)
   :- putBool(bool a in)
   :- putFloat(float a in)
   :- putString(string a in)
